# datamining-practicals
This repository contains some personal exercises to practice datamining in general. The exercises use python as main language.

To be able to do these exercises, consider installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). Anaconda makes it possible to create different environments, this is usefull if you for example need different python installations or different library versions for two projects. More information regarding installing this environment can be found [here](./software.md).
