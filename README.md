# datamining-practicals
This repository contains some personal exercises to practice datamining in general. The exercises use python as main language.

To set up the needed environment and software, please refer to [this file](./software.md).

Some exercises I have made myself, some are based on the [scikit-learn User-Guide](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html) and some are based on exercises in [this course](https://github.com/tueimage/8dm50-machine-learning).

For theory these books are used:
- [Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/), Ian Goodfellow and Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville
- [Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/), Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, Jerome Friedman

If you have ideas for new exercises with regards to datamining, suggestions can be made [here](https://github.com/dloeffen/datamining-practicals/issues). If you have a fully worked example in a fork, please add a Pull Request [here](https://github.com/dloeffen/datamining-practicals/pulls).
