    "The $k$ nearest neighbor is based on the simple idea that when a sample is close to other samples, changes are that they share the same label. To know how close one sample is from another sample, there needs to be a notion of close. For this application we will use euclidian distance also known as the $L^2$ norm\n",

    "### Classification\n",
    "In classification we would like to assign certain samples to a class. To do so we would like to implement an algorithm that assigns the class based on the classes of the $k$ nearest neighbors. Try to do so in `.code/knn.py`"
